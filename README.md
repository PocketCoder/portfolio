# Gallery of works
Must have folders named `photos`, `videos`, and/or `scripts`.

## Script
Run the setup script with python3.

## TODO
### ASAP
1. Store video file type in JSON (for auto-generated `video` tag).
2. Sort items by year, then alphabetical.
3. Allow images to be clickable (into a gallery).
### Any time
1. Allow user to input their own directories.
2. Allow user to add/remove the items keys.
3. Better handling if the directory isn't there.
4. Allow more file types to be opened.
